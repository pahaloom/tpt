#summary The ThreadLocal pattern is used to easily keep track of application instances or locale settings throughout the handling of a request. The ThreadLocal class works like a static variable, with the exception that it is only bound to the current thread! This allows us to use static variables in a thread-safe way.

= Introduction =

ThreadLocal pattern is described here at Vaadin's wiki: [http://dev.itmill.com/wiki/Patterns/ThreadLocale]. The TPTApplication class already implements this pattern, so all you need is to just call TPTApplication.getCurrentApplication() in any portion of your Vaadin-enabled application.
